#Work History#
##IT Intern at Meijer (Retailer)
*Grand Rapids, MI - May 2016 through August 2016*

I took the initiative of managing a project where I ended up designing, developing, and deploying a fully automated linux solution that took the project from years to less than a month.
I converted millions of non-searchable PDFs to a searchable format, increasing efficiency around the company.

I was also given a web/active directory project, which no one could come up with a solution for. I designed, and developed a solution within the scope of my internship that saved the company from buying a very expensive alternative.

I also built an internal iOS application from scratch that you could use to search for where people were around the campus.

##Lead iOS Developer at RenewU (Early stage)
*Los Angeles, CA (remote work) - July 2015 through October 2015*

I was recruited to build an iOS MVP from scratch. The app included native map functionality, and persistent state changes (similar to the Uber ride experience). I collaborated with a designer and completed the app within 4 months, while full-time in school (sophmore at Hope College) starting August.

##CoFounder of QuickQuestion
*October 2014 through present*

We are creating the next semi-anonymous voting social media platform. QuickQuestion (QQ) is an app targeting millennials for social querying. Social querying will augment daily activities.

I am the sole iOS developer, my responsibilties include managing a team of a designer and another developer to project success.

##Computer Support Technician (Student position)
*Holland, MI - January 2015 through May 2016*

I was recommended for this position by a CS professor.
I managed Hope College's library website, and I developed a variety of prototypes from ideas around the office. These ideas inspired me to become more experienced with Windows systems, databases, and gaming engines (Unity). I also wrote technical documentation for systems I developed.

##Internship at Compuware
*Detroit, MI - June 2014*

I participated in a mobile app challenge hosted by my high school, in which we were rewarded with a month internship at Compuware. I learned application performance management, took a company sponsored certification and passed.
