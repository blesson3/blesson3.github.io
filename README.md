#Work History#
##IT Intern at Meijer (Retailer)
*Grand Rapids, MI - May 2016 through August 2016*

I overtook and managed a project where I designed, developed, and deployed a fully automated linux solution that took the project from years to less than a month.
I converted millions of non-searchable PDFs to a searchable format, increasing efficiency around the company.

I was also given a web/active directory project, which no one could come up with a solution for. I designed, and developed a solution within the scope of my internship that saved the company from buying a very expensive alternative.

##Lead iOS Developer at RenewU (Early stage)
*July 2015 through October 2015*
Los Angeles (I worked remotely from Holland, MI)

I was recruited to build an iOS MVP* from scratch. The app included native map functionality, and persistent state changes (similar to the Uber ride experience).
