= Bug Reporting

```
Post/Thread in AskImpulse Slack #bugs

Slack top level: *[short description of the issue]*
Thread comments:
* [detailed bug description]
* [how to reproduce the issue]
* [other details?]
* [image/movie links]
```

== Purpose
This makes it super easy for developers to go through and parse bug reports. The
easier it is for us to identify and understand the issue, the faster weâ€™re able
to work on fixing the bug! Please put effort into these descriptions. The fewer
questions we need to ask to get information the better.

Thank you!
