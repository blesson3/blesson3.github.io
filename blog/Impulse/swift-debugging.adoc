== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide standard and Impulse-specific
Swift/Xcode debugging techniques and procedures. The audience of this document
is Impulse iOS developers.

A bug is any aspect of the Impulse app that is not represented to the user as
intended by the Impulse Product team. Including

. layout/UI malfunction (i.e. views are squashed together)
. data mis-representation (i.e. votes display incorrect numbers)
. #Todo: add more...#

== Bug Report Format

Hereâ€™s the standard format for a bug report:

```
Post/Thread in AskImpulse Slack #bugs

Slack top level: *[short description of the issue]*
Thread comments:
* [detailed bug description]
* [how to reproduce the issue]
* [other details?]
* [image/movie links]
```

See the link:bug-reporting.adoc[bug repos doc] for more info.

== Factors for Reproducing

The following are factors that are important to consider when attempting to
reproduce a bug.

- Device iOS (are they on a beta?)
- Device type (iPhone 8 vs XR)
- Follow the steps to reproduce in the bug report format
- Build number
- Build version
- Environment (Production vs. Beta vs. Development)
- Video evidence (notice the small details)

== Xcode

There are many many resources on how to debug an exception (usual cause of a
crash) using Xcode.

== Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble reproducing the reported bug, try the following:

Note: ordered in least-work to most-work

. *Ask for more information:* have the reporter to clarify: steps to reproduce
and <<reproduce-factors, factors for reproducing>>
. *Check for crash logs:* see firebase.google.com -> Crashlytics for crash
reports and stack traces
. *Walk the code (brute-force):* go to the section of the project where you
might believe the code is crashing and check for implicit unwrapping `variable!`
or potential invalid values for variables that may cause the app to crash.
"Walk" the code by going through function calls and variable inputs.
. *Plug in their device:* if you are geographically close to the team member
experiencing a crash, then have them plug their device into your Xcode and have
them reproduce.
