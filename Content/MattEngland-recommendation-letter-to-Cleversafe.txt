Dear Cleversafe recruiter,

I'm a co-founder of Cleversafe (now IBM Cloud Object Storage). I'm writing to encourage you to hire Matt Blessed. He offers unique skills and reliable work engagement that's as good as demonstrated by the team I led that built the core of the Cleversafe technology. I know this because I've had Matt work for me in a similar capacity on another effort.

Further, Matt has demonstrated to me significant drive to start projects and businesses on his own initiative, with minimal funding. He finds a way. To demonstrate this in any context is excellent, and to do it at his age is quite remarkable.

Don't miss an opportunity to employ someone great. I'd recommend hiring Matt while he's still available. He won't be for long.

Regards,
Matt England
