We ❤️ Slack threads.

== General Formatting/Style

Slack has a great
link:https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages[help
post] on this.

.Common styles:
. \*Bold* = *Bold* +
. \_Italics_ = _Italics_ +
. _`Code` = `Code`


== How to start a conversation/topic

. Find the appropriate Slack channel
. Make a top *Topic* post using the `\*Topic*` format (i.e. \*How to Use
Slack Threads*)
. Post the first message in the thread under the single *Topic* post using
the *Reply to thread* button on the post

.The result should look something like this

NOTE: Make sure to post in the thread when replying, do not post to the
whole channel when replying

.This is what we want all of our Slack channels to look like!
